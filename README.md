# Image Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (iJEPA) Implementation

An implementation of Facebook Research's iJEPA (Image Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) model for self-supervised learning on images using PyTorch.

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of iJEPA, a self-supervised learning approach for images that uses a joint embedding predictive architecture. The model learns visual representations by predicting masked regions of images from their surrounding context.

## Key Features

- Implementation of context and target encoders using Vision Transformers
- Patch embedding with positional encodings
- Multi-head self-attention mechanisms
- Context-target prediction framework
- Support for random masking strategies

## Model Architecture

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **Context Encoder**: Processes visible patches of the image
2. **Target Encoder**: Encodes masked regions 
3. **Predictor**: Predicts target representations from context embeddings

## Requirements

```
torch
torchvision
numpy
tqdm
```

## Usage

```python
# Initialize models
context_encoder = VisionTransformer(...)
target_encoder = VisionTransformer(...)
predictor = VisionTransformer_predictor(...)

# Train the model
train_iJEPA(context_encoder, target_encoder, predictor, num_epochs=10)
```

## Training Details

- Uses AdamW optimizer
- Momentum update for target encoder (momentum = 0.996)
- Loss function based on L2 distance between predicted and target representations
- Supports batch training with customizable batch sizes
- Built-in data augmentation including random horizontal flips and normalization

## Data Loading

The code supports loading image datasets using PyTorch's ImageFolder:

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    transforms.Resize(IMG_SIZE),
    transforms.CenterCrop(IMG_SIZE),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root='path/to/dataset', transform=transform)
```
